## Making the Bundestag open data more accessible 

>- **btmembers** is an R package designed to make the the Bundestag open data more accessible.
>- The Bundestag distributes biographical and election data on all its members since 1949.
>- The data is only available in **XML**, a format difficult to work with.

## Problem

>- XML files have a tree-like structure
>- Arbitrary number of dimensions

## A look at the original data

## btmembers: facilitating comparison between multiple members

>- XML data is problematic if we want to **compare** multiple members
>- Faced with this problem while working on _Smarte Spalter_ (Chap. 10: Schroeder, WeÃŸels, and Joly, 2019).
>- btmembers makes the procedure reproducible and accessible to everyone. 

## btmembers: what it does

>- btmembers imports the file "Stammdaten aller Abgeordneten seit 1949 im XML-Format" and turns it into a rectangular dataset.
>- Unit of analysis: member-term
>- All the original data is preserved, except...
>- Only the most recent names are preserved.
>- Parliamentary functions are not reported. 

## Installation

>- btmembers is currently hosted on Github.

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jolyphil/btmembers")
```

## Preloaded data

- btmembers comes preloaded with the processed tabular dataset.
- Data is stored in the `members` object:

```{r preloaded_data, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(btmembers)
members
```

```{r preloaded_data_kable, message = FALSE}
library(btmembers)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
members %>% 
  filter(id == "11001478") %>% 
  select(id, nachname, vorname, geburtsdatum, wp, mdbwp_von) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options="scale_down")
```

## Current version of the dataset

The current version of the dataset (`r attr(members, "version")`)  contains `r nrow(members)` observations from `r length(unique(btmembers::members$id))` members. The data includes `r ncol(btmembers::members)` variables:

```{r variables}
names(members)
```

## Check for updates

- btmembers can extract new, updated data from the Bundestag.
- Check if a more recent version of the data is available. 

```{r update_available, echo = TRUE}
update_available()
```

## Import new data

- Import a more recent version of the dataset.

```{r import_members, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
members_new <- import_members()
```

## Applications

- btmembers is particularly useful for:
  1. Research on political representation
  2. Teaching
  
## Representation of women

```{r women, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
share_women <- members %>%
  mutate(faction = case_when(
    partei_kurz == "CDU" | partei_kurz == "CSU" ~ "Union",
    partei_kurz == "SPD" ~ "SPD",
    partei_kurz == "FDP" ~ "FDP")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(faction)) %>%
  group_by(faction, wp) %>%
  summarize(women = mean(geschlecht == "weiblich"))
```

```{r women_graph, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = share_women, aes(x = wp, y = women, color = faction)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), breaks = 1:19) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("yellow", "red", "black")) +
  ggtitle("Share of female members by faction") +
  xlab("Parliamentary terms") + 
  ylab("Share of female members")
```

## Occupational structure: First parliamentary term

The ten most common occupations of the members of the **first** parliamentary term. 

```{r occupations_wp01}
library(magrittr)

occup_table <- function(members, wp){
  members$beruf[members$wp == wp] %>% 
  table() %>% 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>% 
  extract(1:10) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  set_colnames(c("Occupation", "Freq")) %>%
  kable() 
}

occup_table(members, 1)
```

## Occupational structure: Current parliamentary term

The ten most common occupations of the members of the **current** parliamentary term. 

```{r occupations_wp19}
occup_table(members, 19)
```

## Teaching

>- The package is well-suited for exercises on data visualization, clustered data, and textual analysis.
>- A great resource for classes on political representation
>- An easily accessible repertoire of facts about German parliamentary history

## Remaining problems

>- Problems related to the package itself
>- Problems with the original data

## Problems with the package itself

>- btmembers is slow. 
>- Data is lost: parliamentary functions and older names.

## Problems with the original data

>- Some variables should have been coded as factors: `geschlecht`, `familienstand`, `religion`, `partei_kurz`, `liste`, and `mandatsart`.
>- `partei_kurz` does not take into account changes in party affiliation.
>- `geburtsland` is not coded systematically.

## Conclusion

>- btmembers is a useful resource for researchers, journalists, teachers, and the broader public. 
>- It unpacks the Bundestag open data and turns it into a more accessible dataset.
